# Virtual-Memory-Optimizer
A Python-based project for virtual memory optimization using page replacement algorithms
Virtual Memory Optimizer is a Python-based project designed to simulate and analyze different page replacement algorithms for efficient memory management. The project aims to reduce page faults, prevent thrashing, and optimize system performance by implementing algorithms such as:

FIFO (First-In-First-Out)

LRU (Least Recently Used)

Optimal Page Replacement

Second-Chance Algorithm

Enhanced LRU with AI-based Prediction

Features
 Simulates virtual memory allocation and management
 Implements multiple page replacement algorithms
 Analyzes page fault rate and memory usage efficiency
 Compares algorithm performance under different workloads
 Uses Python and data visualization tools for results analysis
